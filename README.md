## Lake Atitlan Discharge

#### This notebook retrieves streamflow into Lake Atitlan, Guatemala from the GEOGloWS ECMWF Streamflow Services. See https://geoglows.ecmwf.int/. It then integrates the streamflow to get daily discharge into the lake. This was created for use in an algae bloom prediction algorithm developed by researchers at NASA SERVIR.
